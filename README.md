# Presto
Presto is a window manager that focusses on simplicity and efficiency that will suit my needs.

## Why?
Why not?

## Features:
Once finished Presto will come with the following features:

### Simple window tyling
Only a master and stack layout, more might be added later down the line.

### Key Workspaces
Set a workspace as a key workspace and quickly acess it using super and the hjkl keys.

### Floating mode
i3 like window manager floating mode, there's no need to reinvent the wheel.
